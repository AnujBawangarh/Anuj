    Disney and Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” returns to the mind of newly minted teenager Riley just as headquarters is undergoing a sudden demolition to make room for something entirely unexpected: new Emotions! Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who’ve long been running a successful operation by all accounts, aren’t sure how to feel when Anxiety shows up. And it looks like she’s not alone. 

Maya Hawke lends her voice to Anxiety, alongside Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Lewis Black as Anger, Tony Hale as Fear, and Liza Lapira as Disgust. Directed by Kelsey Mann and produced by Mark Nielsen, “Inside Out 2” releases only in theaters Summer 2024.

<h1 class="h1">Joy</h1>
<br>
<p class="p">Joy is back and ready to tackle teenagerhood – the joyous highs, the tearful lows, the blistering frustrations, nauseating changes and frighteningly awkward moments that Riley’s new teenage world has to offer. With Riley’s happiness as her first priority, Joy is determined to protect Riley’s Sense of Self and help her stay the same happy kid she knows and loves. Optimistic, lighthearted and bubbling with bright ideas for their girl’s future, nothing will derail Joy’s plan for Headquarters - that is, until new emotions move in</p>
